Neta Miguel Osorio Jabali Coyote Tepextate Madrecuixe 49.4% (Spirits Review #11 Mezcal #11)

This ensamble from Miguel Osorio is made at the same palenque as the
wonderful Astor exclusive tepextate from Gilberto (Gilberto's father,
Cuberto's palenque). The label incorrectly states Tobala is used in the
ensamble, when it is actually tepextate. Mezcal from new producers
is always fun to try. 

Nose: Cinammon and cumin. Lots of minerality. Smells like wet stone in a creek.
I detect a hint of some acidity. Something like a particularly tart kiwi.
There's something on the nose that reminds me of grape leaves in lebanese food.
A nutty note also jumps out. Cashew maybe. Really fun to smell a lot of
things here.

Palate: Good sweetness and cinammon up front. Then some sweet ripe
banana arrives.
A dank moss note comes in after this sweet entry.
Then lots of acidity that
wasn't present on the nose. This is very interesting. Kind of like tart
red grapes. This is kind of a wacky profile yet, I dig it a lot.
Mouthfeel is good too. Not gripping but it wears its proof well.

Finish: The grape leaves and cinammon meld on the finish. That cashew
is there too. Medium-long to long length. The minerality lingers long
at least, even after other flavors fade.

Overall: This is an oddball profile. If someone got the impression that
Neta bottles a lot of clean and pretty distillate (which they do), then I'd
pour this as a counterpoing. It's not that it's not clean so much as the
profile brings a lot of interesting notes to the table that you don't find
often. The complexity is there even though it doesn't feel entirely cohesive.
It doesn't rise to the highs of Neta's best, but it's just fun.
