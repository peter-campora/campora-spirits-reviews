Neta Primitivo Mexicano Verde/Bicuixe 46.3% (Spirits Review #9 Mezcal #9)

This ensamble of Mexicano Verde and Bicuixe was a batch for the June Hotel
Swim Club. I believe that the Mexicano Verde used for this batch were
30+ years old and planted by Primitivo's father.

Nose: Chocolate. Orange zest. Wood. Green beans.

Palate: Big chocolate notes. A bit of salt. Those green bean notes. Then
more chocolate. A bit of damp vegetation.

Finish: Loads of chocolate. A slight bit of salinity.

Overall: Really tasty for those who like those chocolate notes in their
Mexicano. Really desserty profile. Has gotten more desserty with air time in
the bottle. A very good mezcal that's just missing that little something
for me that would make it a great mezcal for my palate. A bit more oomph
would just push it over the edge. But the chocolately profile with a hint
of we vegetation is nice.
