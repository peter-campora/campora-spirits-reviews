Mal Bien Victor Ramos Sierra Negra (Spirits Review #8 Mezcal #8)

I forgot the lot number and couldn't find the batch info on Mal Bien's site. I do remember it ended with VR, though.

Nose: Such a strong fruit gum note. Strawberries. A hint of leaves.

Palate: So much bubble gum up front. It's followed by cherry and then an odd spice. It kind of reminds me of cherry limeade.

Finish: There's some spice and earthy veggies (potatoes and carrots?) toward the finish. Good length.

Overall: This is a nice value. I have my biases. The Ramos duo hits often for my palate. Victor's mezcal especially.

Score: 8-/10
