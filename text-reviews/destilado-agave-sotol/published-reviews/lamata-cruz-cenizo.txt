Lamata Familia Cruz Cenizo

This Cenizo comes from Enrique and Federico Cruz at 52.5% abv. So far the Familia Cruz bottlings have been favorites of mine from the Lamata lineup, along with Sosimo Jarquin's various expressions. This is one of the more affordable bottlings in the Lamata lineup. Lot CEN-C 12/1/2020

Nose: Watermelon jolly ranchers! There's a hint of balsalmic vinegar. There's also some tart strawberries.

Palate: The attack is a strong helping of watermelon, candy, and balsalmic. It feels less candied than the noses suggests. It's tart like jolly rancher candy, with some nice acidity. There's a thick mouthfeel on this. With water added some bubblegum joins in to mellow out some of the acidic watermelon nose.

Finish: Unfortunately, the finish is a tad hot. The 52.5% makes itself none. There's also a bit of an acrid plastic note. It's joined however by this nice basil and basalmic note that reminds me of caprese salad. The finish is drier than the palate and feels slightly disjoint.

Overall: This is a fun and powerful expression and the palate is right up my alley, sans some of the heat. Some flaws on the finish hold this back from excellence, but I still really enjoy this pour overall. Water helps tame some of the harsh notes, although I rarely feel inclined to proof down mezcal.
