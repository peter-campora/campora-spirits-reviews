Hermogenes Azulin (Spirits Review #5 Mezcal #5)

This batch of Azulin from Hermogenes was bought at his palenque in Logoche. Despite what the name may lead you to believe, this is not tequilana but an agave Americana. It is 50% abv. Hermogenes has had bottles under multiple brands with several batches bottled under Neta.

Nose: Brown sugar, blueberry, and plum lead the way. There's just this sweet blue/purple fruit profile I like with a hint of something vegetal there in the background.

Palate: A bit of a subtle attack. Blueberry and sugar then some green spinach like note which I suppose corresponds to the vegetal note on the nose. It's follwed by a bit of gum. There's a lighter mouthfeel here and not much acidity. There's a bit of a lactic yogurt like note, but nothing strong like what can appear in raicilla.

Finish: A really pleasant vanilla like roundness appears on the finish. It reminds me of berry chantilly cake. Unfortunately the finish is short, which is ashame because what is there is quite nice.

Overall: I love the profile on this, but the thinner mouthfeel and short finish really detract from the experience.
