Neta Hermogenes and Paula Arroqueno (Spirits Review #6 Mezcal #6)

This batch of Arooqueno from Hermogenes and Paula was made from 9 pinas of Arroqueno from a nearby community. This was their first 100% arroqueno batch due to its scarcity in the area. This was a batch for the EU market.

This will be the first of quite a lot of Neta reviews from me, as Neta is arguably my favorite brand.

Nose: Cinammon, brown sugar, and plantain lead the way. There's a bit of a funky acidic smell along with a kitchen cleaner like scent.

Palate: Lots of round brown sugar up front. Then acidity joins it. It's some lime and orange. There's an odd almost pita-bread like note in there too. I'm not totally in love with the profile, but the mouthfeel here is very good and the complexity is there.

Finish: Wood hits towards the finish. The finish feels slightly odd in its transition and it dries out the mouth. Moderately long length.

Overall: There's good complexiy and strength of character here, but the profile just doesn't quite jive with me.

Score: 6+/10
