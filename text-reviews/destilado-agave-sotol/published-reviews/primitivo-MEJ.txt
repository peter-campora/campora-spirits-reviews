Neta Primitivo Madrecuixe Espadin Jabali 47.3% (Spirits Review #10 Mezcal #10)

This ensamble of Madrecuixe Espadin and Jabali was a CA exclusive batch
of Neta. It was a favorite during the Neta virtual tasting with
Tahona Mercado.

Nose: Vanilla. Kind of like an orange cream soda. Really lovely nose.
A touch of that kimchi I sometimes find with Miahuatlan jabali.

Palate: Wow bright and fruity. Big orange notes with a bit of lemon.
A bit of underripe pineapple and perhaps some canteloupe.
Some salinity. That kimchi is there too. Just this nice combination of
these yellow/orange fruit and a bit of saltiness. Decent mouthfeel.

Finish: Spice on the finish. A bit like cayenne fun transition. The salinity
and minerality is on full display. Medium-long to long length. 

Overall: Wow this is stellar. I feel like a lot of these CA exclusive
Pueblo de Sabor batches are just bangers. I've only had one CA batch I didn't
like and several were great. Mouthfeel is one of the few areas this could be better.
The other is that though all aspects of the profile are great, they don't feel
completely cohesive at times. This profile agrees with me. I think
I might acquire a bottle.
