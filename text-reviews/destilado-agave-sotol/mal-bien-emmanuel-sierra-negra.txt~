Mal Bien Emmanuel Ramos Sierra Negra (Spirits Review #7 Mezcal #7)

The lot is: 0520ER. I'm assuming this is Emmanuel Ramos since this lot ends with ER, and the other I tried ends with VR.

Nose: Lime. Wet bushes. A hint of gum. Nose is dominated by the lime/cirtus note.

Palate: There's more gum on the palate, but the lime persists along with some wood notes and spring mix esque notes. There's a bit of a petrol note that's off putting.

Finish: Herbs appear in the finish and join that tart lime. On the shorter side, length wise.

Overall: I got this for a good price, so I'd say the bottle is worth it, but it's not my favorite pour from Emmanuel Ramos. It's better than the Madrecuixe/Bicuixe/Tepextate but not as good as some of his other bottles with Mal Bien. I like the slightly candied lime that appears, although there's other notes that detract from the experience for me.
