Derrumbes Durango

This mezcal is made by Antonio Panaca "El Tigre" in Durango with agave cenizo. This is 45% ABV. Lot A9.

Nose: Black tea leaves and lemon. A bit of creamed corn. There's an herbal note. Maybe oregano? There's some slightly funky cheese note that reminds me of cotija.

Palate: This has a sweet entry. It really reminds me of southern sweet tea. A bit of that creamed corn from the nose returns. The mouthfeel is sadly a bit thin.

Finish: The herbal oregano like note lends a drying finish that balances out the sweet tea that appeared earlier. The length is on the shorter side of moderate, though it does remain for more than a moment. The transition between the palate and the finish is nice.

Overall: A nice spring/summer sipper. It reminds me of drinking sweet tea on a porch or patio in the hot Louisiana summer. It's good but unfortunately it lacks both the complexity or strength to get into very good territory.
