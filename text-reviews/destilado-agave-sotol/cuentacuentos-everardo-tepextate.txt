Cuentacuentos Tepeztate by Everardo Garcia Salvador (Spirits Review #2 Mezcal #2)

This batch of Tepeztate by Everardo is hybrid distilled like his madrecuishe batch. This I believe is one of Everardo's last batches before he passed away.

Lot 34-MC

Aroma: This is less sweet than his madrecuishe batch on the nose. I get lots of lemongrass and minerality. There still is a sweet thread throughout this that reminds me of the cornbread I grew up eating in Louisiana.

Palate: This is sweeter up front on the palate than on the nose. These hybrid distilled batches match up really well on the nose and palate. The minerality and lemongrass come towards the finish. I feel like there's also some slightly green banana imparting a slightly tart note. The balance between the green notes produced by the tepextate and the sweeter cornbread notes and minerality that I would guess come from the clay run is exceptional. Whereas the madrecuishe felt a bit more cohesive, this feels like a tug of war where neither side is gaining dominance. Great mouthfeel on this.

Finish: Fantastic finish. The minerality and banana intertwines, but the banana feels sweeter than it initially was on the palate. Good length

Overall: Wow, what a wonderful batch from Everardo. The balance here is fantastic. It's hard to complain about anything, but if I had to nitpick I think a hair more complexity would make this an all-time favorite with me. The bottle is still relatively untouched, so I'm hoping I find that touch of complexity with a bit more time working through the bottle.
