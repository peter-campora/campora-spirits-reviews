Cuentacuentos Daniel Leon Tobala (Spirits Review #20 Mezcal #20)

This is a tobala (A. potatorum) from Sola de Vega made by Daniel Leon. It comes in at 45.88% abv. I believe this is a guest expression
for Cuentacuentos, which means it's not from a producer who will regularly be making batches for Cuentacuentos.

Nose: There's a surprising leather note up front followed by red apples and chocolate pudding.

Taste: Sweet pear mixed with that leather book note. Some earthiness from the clay pot follows. A bit of black pepper
mixes in. With air time more of a milk chocolae note comes out along with the pear. I may have just acclimated to the
leather note.

Finish: Slate joins the leather towards the finish. Good length.

Overall: Fun profile. Good complexity. It doesn't have quite as much body as I'd like. It's not quite my preferred
profile, but I still enjoyed drinking this. I enjoy the tobala batches I've had from Angel Cruz Calvo more.
