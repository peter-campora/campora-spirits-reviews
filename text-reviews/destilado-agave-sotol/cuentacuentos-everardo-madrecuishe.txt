Cuentacuentos Madrecuishe by Everardo Garcia Salvador (Spirits Review #1 Mezcal #1)

This batch of Madrecuishe by Everardo is interesting due to being a hybrid distillation with a clay pot run and a copper pot run. Everardo hails from San Pablo Mitla, which is an area I have not had mezcals from other than those from Everardo.

Aroma: Sweet up front. There's a beignet-esque scent here with a balance between sweet sugary notes and buttery pastry notes. There's a hint of wet cement followed by wet green bean.

Palate: This is wonderfully sweet and round. The palate follows the nose quite well with the pastry notes a bit more subdued, but the mouthfeel is full and buttery. The clay pot doesn't totally cover up the karwinskii green bean and spinach notes I often get. But this isn't woody like some madrecuixe can be.

Finish: Moderate length. Reminds me a bit of those small grocery store donuts.

Overall: This hybrid distillation is wonderful. I haven't properly reviewed his copper pot tobala, but I prefer this. Typically, I'm not the biggest clay distilled karwinskii fan. I feel like the clay tends to dominate the karwinskii on many of the expressions from Minas I've tried. I really feel like the clay influence here really compliments the madrecuixe instead of smothering it. It's not the most complex madrecuixe I've had, but it's a great value and one I could drink regularly.
